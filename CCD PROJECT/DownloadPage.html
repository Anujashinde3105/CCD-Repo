    <h3>What is a Bean?</h3>

      <li>Beans are the reward points you earn whenever you make a food or beverage purchase from
        <br> our stores using the www.ccdonline.in portal
      </li>
      <li>You get up to 7% Beans as cash back on every spend on food and/or beverages</li>
      <li>On redemption, the value of 1 Bean = Re. 1</li>
      <li>Beans are earned on the base price of the item after discount, before tax and less Beans
        <br> redeemed during the transaction.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Earning Beans</h4>
    <p>You earn beans every time you use ccdonline.in portal to place a food or beverage order</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Earn up to 7% cashback on the transaction value (excluding beans redeemed, discounts &
        <br> taxes). 7% Beans earning will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Redemption of Beans</h4>
    <p>You can redeem your earned Beans against any beverage purchase (excluding Beverages available
      <br> under the “totally Worth it menu’, combos and packaged beverages) at any CCD store (excluding
      <br> CCD Express and CCD Airport Cafes).
    </p>
    <p>.The ccdonline.in portal is applicable across vast network of cafes. However, from time-to-time, there
      <br> will be select cafes which will be exempt for a temporary period from Beans redemption due to <br> technical
      constraints / changes.
    </p>
    <p>Beans are redeemed only against non-combos and non-packaged beverages, on your final billed
      <br> value after discount and after tax. However Beans cannot be redeemed against Beverages available <br>
      under the “Totally Worth It” menu.
    </p>
    <p>1 Bean is equivalent to Re. 1.</p>
    <h3>Do Beans have an expiry date?</h3>
    <p>Purchased Beans and Beans earned on transactions have a validity of 180 days from the day of
      <br> earning, post which they will expire.
    </p>
    <p>For example, if you have earned Beans through transactions on 15th August, 2020, they will expire <br>
      on 11th February, 2021 (12:00 AM).</p>
    <h3>What can I purchase with my accumulated Beans?</h3>

      <br> “Totally Worth It” menu, combos and Packaged Beverages) from our CCD
      <br> stores (excluding CCD Express and CCD Airport Cafes.)

      <li>Sure! You can opt for paying with Beans/cash/card or combine all of these options to make
        <br>a payment for your purchases.
